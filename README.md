# Minesweeper in progress

Tried to get all of the features in there, but still don't have the one where you double click to open cells adjacent to a fully marked numbered cell...

Try it out https://www.grgrssll.com/minesweeper/

TODO

- write more tests
- tweak cell clearing (click gesture) not sure if compliant behavior - needs cell depressing for adjacents - perhaps only when flagged adjacent mines matches number? what if over?
- make best times screen
- offline support
